This Python script helps you analyze a log file (nodejsapp.log) generated by a Node.js application. It focuses on three main things:

Counting how many times each IP address accessed your server.

Analyzing how active each IP is in a 10-second window after its first request.

Counting how often each browser/device (User Agent) accessed the server.

Counting how many times each endpoint (URL path) was accessed.


A line in the log file looks like this : 2025-06-11T12:00:00.123Z 192.168.0.1 GET /api/plants HTTP/1.1" 200 - "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
From this line, the script extracts:

Timestamp: When the request was made

IP Address: Who made the request

HTTP Method and Endpoint: What was requested

User Agent: Which browser or device was used






Regular expressions (regex) help find specific patterns in text (like IP addresses).

Counter is a Python tool to count how often things appear.

Defaultdict automatically handles new entries for counting.

Datetime helps manage timestamps and durations.
