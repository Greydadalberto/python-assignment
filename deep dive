1. For each IP address, check to see how many requests came in after the first request in a 10 sec window.
2. write a script to determine the number of request coming from each end user agent type
3. write a script to count the number of times each endpoint was accessed.


sol
1. Approach:
Parse logs by timestamp and IP.

For each IP, find the first timestamp.

Count how many additional requests occurred within the 10 seconds after that timestamp.

2. Determine the number of requests coming from each end user agent type
✅ Approach:
Extract user agent string from each log line.

Count frequency of each user agent.

3. Count the number of times each endpoint was accessed
✅ Approach:
Extract the endpoint from the request portion of the log.

Tally how many times each endpoint appears.
